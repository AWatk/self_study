----------------------------------------------------------------

:Authors:
   Kolmanovsky, Ilya
   McClamroch, N. Harris

:DOI:
   10.1109/37.476384

Notes
^^^^^

Published in 1995, gives a summarization of the state of the art at the time for control on nonholonomic systems.

Nonholonmic Models are classified into **Kinematic Models** and **Dynamic Models**



Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Review dynamics textbooks and reread to flesh out notes

Notes
^^^^^

Overview of nonholonomic planners.

Mention of *compliant motion planning* for navigating in the presence of uncertainty


Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Review dynamics textbooks and latombe's motion planning and reread to flesh out notes.

Notes
^^^^^

Master's Thesis in electrical engineering. Halmstad University

Objective is to find a better, cheaper solution of push detection than force sensors in the rims of a wheelchair

Uses velocity feedback for detecting pushes

Controller is designed to be sensitive to distrubances instead of rejecting them.

Uses a wheelchair model presented by Hori and Oh

Starts with a velocity-as-push-detection model by Hori and Oh

Details extracting pushes from velocity and the descretization of the model for this.

Afterwards details two velocity disturbance observed controllers, *proportional* and *proportional-derivative*

Then modifies a power wheelchair (hub based manual) to perform the push detection and push assist.


Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Much of the work is based on a paper by Hori and Oh. Read it!

Notes
^^^^^

Details a way of using support vector machines to develop a classification of myoelectric waveforms into hand gestures.

Makes use of the Thalmic Labs Myo armband.

Very simple implementation using python svm library
   
Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Should be an easily replicable test for learning SVM and delving into myoelectric measurementa and controls

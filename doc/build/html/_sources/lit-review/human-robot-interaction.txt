Notes

**Chairables**

First introduction to the concept of a chairable, a play on the "wearable" buzzword. A chairable is just anything designed to fit in the footprint of a wheelchair and is useful as an interface or aid.

**Perception**

Brings up the point that many custom accessibility solutions stand out and draw unwanted attention to the user, which causes them to default to generic commercial devices instead.

**Gest Rest**

Introduces the gest-rest, a input device on a powered wheelchair armrest that provides multiple modalities of intereaction, such as buttons, pressure sensitive regions, or gesture input.

Devices made were momentary buttons, d-pads, pressure sensitive pads, and a touch screen, all integrated into the top-front of the armrest.

Main gestures used:

#. Tap (Single, Double, Triple)
#. Holds (Short, Medium, Long)
#. Flick
#. Swipe
#. Drag
#. Lift/Roll/Rock/Squeeze/Punch

A study was done to have wheelchair users rate the utility of these gestures. Both user and clinician feedback was noted on the design, applications, and improvements for the devices.

Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Based on feedback, an interactive device should either be a wearable or located on the armrest of the chair. Otherwise it stands out, is inconvenient, and less usable.

Take into account the perspective of therapists, who were shown to choose a solution based on its versatility vs personal convenience.

Tapping on a force sensor is easier than tapping a button

Using a touch screen is even easier since it requires the least amount of force to activate

   10.1145/2700648.2809845

Notes
^^^^^

Provdes a handy summarization of design considerations for a wheelchair specific fitness tracker.

Addresses the issues with current technology being too able-bodied centric, with the common term for activity being "steps"


Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

To the user, a fitness track should just be a black box that spits out the desired performance metrics. Most users do not particularly care to see the raw data being observed.

There is a need for recognition algorithms for wheelchair metrics and sports



Patrick Carrington - How Power Wheelchair Users Choose Computing Devices

   Carrington, Patrick
   Hurst, Amy
   Kane, Shaun K

:DOI:
   10.1145/2513383.2513426

Notes
^^^^^

A quick sumarization and interview/survey with users on factors affecting device use.

Many users find custom multi-model solutions, such as a combination voice and keyboard text entry

Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

For mobility impaired individuals, finding a solution that accomodates for the strength and dexterity overrides any eaesthetics, function, or other personal preference.

Storing/accessing is an issue. Always-on devices could alleviate this, or devices stored in easily accessible locations on a chair.

Reaching/holding can be more difficult than movement based tracking


Linda Fehr - Adequacy of power wheelchair control interfaces for persons with severe disabilities: A clinical survey
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

:Authors:
   Fehr, L
   Langbein, W E
   Skaar, S B

:PMID:
   10917267

Notes
^^^^^

This details the results of a survey sent out to several clinical facilities asking about the usage of different control interfaces and their adequacy at meeting the patients needs.

Argues for the inclusion of an autonomous layer in powered wheelchair control instead of the development of further interface designs

Briefly references an autonomous wheelchair system called Computer Controlled Powered Wheelchair Navigation System (CPWNS)

Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

According to the survey, 80% of users user a joystick (More recent Permobil numbers say its more like 90%)

A significant (but small) portion of users find that their current control scheme is not adequate to perfom tasks such as go through doors or avoid obstacles due to their disability

:DOI:
   10.1682/JRRD.2007.01.0015

Notes
^^^^^

Briefly describes different types of smart wheelchairs before detailing a great list of symptoms and their prevalence, then attemps to map the symptoms to the best form of smart chair

Mentions the psychological impacts of reduced mobility

Good listing of demographics that can benefit from:

#. Autonomous Navigation
#. Obstacle Avoidance
#. Smart Manual Wheelchairs
#. Smart Powered Wheelchars

   
Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Conceivably more would benefit from basic obstacle avoidance than full autonomous control

More would also benefit from a powered wheelchair than a smart manual wheelchair

Notes
^^^^^

**Dessertation**

Covers devices for functional motor learning in children.

#. Force-feedback joystick using an assist-as-needed paradigm
#. Artificial Potential fields for obstacle avoidance

Study evaluates repelling vs assisting force for learning of line following.

A self-localizing robotic training wheelchair was developed to conduct the studies.

Provides details on training protocols and emotional/social interaction using robotic devices.

**Smart Wheelchair and Novel Control Methods**

Provides an overview of past smart wheelchairs from literature and the pros/cons.

Most early smart wheelchairs such as the NavChair and TAO only used sonar to detect local obstacles and try to avoid them using methods borrowed from mobile robot ressearch.
In these cases, the users are still responsible for any high level planning.

Later chairs start to implement kalman filters and SLAM techniques to allow autonomous travel. SENARIO was one of the first to use lidar and global positioning to allow this.

**Force Field**

Virtual Wall
 Restoring force applied normal to a virtual wall and inversely proportional to the distance from the wall

Centering Effect
 Specific to joystick feedback, a centering force that brings the joystick back to the center

Damping Effect
 Force opposite and proportional to velocity

**Force Field Obstacle Avoidance**

It initially seemed that this study was going to attach a repelling potential field to an obstacle, but in reality a free path is pre-determined and intermediary waypoints are assigned.
The potential field is then based on these intermediary waypoints.

**Social Interaction**

Provides a great case study of implementing localization, tracking, obstacle detection, and path planning.

Provides algorithms for sensor fusion, occupancy grid mapping, controller design

Chair pose is predicted and checked for collision.


Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Both attracting and repelling forces have their uses, but are context sensitive.


Good list of references for papers involving:

#. Early Smart Wheelchairs
#. Sonar
#. Dynamic obstacle avoidance
#. Drive mode selection
#. Outdoor Driving
#. Estimation of Human Intention
#. Mobility and interactiion promotion for special needs

Notes
^^^^^

Provides a detailed overview and examples of types of affeect recognition in HRI.

c
Classfication of affect-detection in HRI scenarios:

:Collaborative Tasks:
    Humans and robots work together
:Assistive Tasks:
    Robots aid a human to complete a task
:Mimicry Tasks:
    Robots and humans perform the same behavior
:Muti-purpose tasks:
    Combination of many aspects

Common modalities of affect detection:

:Facial Expression:
    Most common method of extracting facial information is using a 2D camera. Facial features are mainly extracted from eye, eyebrows, lips, and nose according to FACS. A drawback is that this kind of factial recognition only performs well when the user is positioned directly in front of the camera.
:Body Language:
    A Kinect was mostly used for identifying affect from body language. The most utilized features were the Kinect's skeleton joint positions.
:Voice:
    Affect from voice most commonly achevied using a microphone (duh) worn by the user, such as a lapel mic.
:Physiological Signals:
    Physiological measurements are most commonly done by ECG, EMG and/or skin conductance sensors in order to measure heart rate, facial muscle activity, and skin conductance levels.
:Multi-modal techniques:

Majority of affect-classification techniques incorporate some form of learning.

Most common learning technique by modality:

:Facial Expression:
    Binary Decision Trees,
    AdaBoost,
    Multilayer Perceptrons,
    Support Vector Machines,
    Support Vector Regression,
    Neural Networks,
    Dynamic Bayesian Networks,
:Body Language:
    Support Vector Machines,
    K Nearest Neighbor,
:Voice:
    Gaussian Mixture Model,
    Support Vector Machines,
    Naive Bayes,
    Hidden Markov Models,
:Physiological:
    fuzzy models,
    Hidden Markov Models,
    Support Vector Machines,
    Neural Networks
:Multi-modal:
    Support Vector Machines,
    Hidden Markov Models,
    Bayesian Network,
    Neural Network,
    Statistical Methods,

Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

Affect-detection has been used in the past for assistive/collaborative physical tasks such as robot-arm assisted lifting of an object. This could be viewed as a shared control problem and applied to the shared control of a mobile robot


The effect of robotic wheelchair control paradigm and interface on user performance, effort and preference: An experimental assessment

   Argall, Brenna D.

:DOI:
   10.1016/j.robot.2017.04.013

Notes
^^^^^

Examines various wheelchair control paradigms, including manual, semi-autonomous, and autonomous control. Investigates techniques for sharing control between the user and an autonomous system.

Found that no control paradigm came out as "best" and that it is very dependent on the end-user's preferences. Results show that what might be the most optimal according to typical metrics can defer from what is most accepted.

Details shared control techniques and emphasises the partitioning of control spaces.

Example of a Wizard of Oz study

Provides an example of a modular wheelchair platform based on ROS.

Takeaways
^^^^^^^^^

There needs to be a new layer between user input and the wheelchair in which the user's intent and needs are used to fuse their controls with an autonomous controller.
